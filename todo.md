# bugs
-paradise water generation should be higher than normal, might just be getting unlucky tho
-not really a bug, just a feature I changed my mind about, don't generate cobblestone and mossy cobblestone in caves worlds

# features
- custom themes (custom tree gen, noise values, each block is replaceable, accounts for world gen type)
- winter theme blocks (snow, snow block, ice, snowy grass)
- winter theme (normal, but snow on top of everything and use snowy grass instead of regular grass, ice instead of water)
- jungle theme (BIGGASS TREES FOR EPIC TREEHOUSE YES GOOD)
- add pine tree lookin trees to winter theme
- add seperate passive and hostile spawn weight options
- add hostile and passive mob health multiplier options (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0)
- survival mode health bar, gameover screen, item system
- survival mode inventory, crafting, chest, furnace
- option to do list crafting or grid crafting
- add room and corridor generation to be able to make randomly generated structures
- add minecarts, rails, minecart chest/furnace/tnt, powered rails
- add slimes (them green bouncy things that split apart)


- Instead of mobs taking 10 damage per second in lava, make them take 5 damage per half second so they actually sound like they are being hurt and dont just die pretty much silently
- make the player not able to spawn on the invisible cieling on hell mode, and on floating mode, the player should always spawn on one of the islands and not on the invisible floor.
- make ores unable to generate in dirt unless the hell theme is enabled, and the generation type is caves
- remove cobblestone and mossy cobblestone from cave world type generation, unless the hell world type is enabled
